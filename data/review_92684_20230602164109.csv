Furthermore, to secure the sensor behind the patella during IP IMN, we had to create medial and lateral arthrotomies. We thereby released the retinaculum on both sides of the knee. Both of these factors may  have  decreased  the  actual  amount  of  contact  pressure applied   across   the   patella   femoral   joint   during   standard IP IMN."
